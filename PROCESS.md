#Day 1

Made a list with all functions needed for each class. 
Also made the choise to give the functions of chatting and a history of the things you've done a secondary priority in the process.
Made an overview with how the classes and their functions would send function with each other.
Also made an overview how the UI reacts with the different classes on the background

#Day 2

Searched information about Parse and how apps as Tinder and Uber use their account data base.
Am trying to get to know Parse better and figuring out how I will be able to implement my idea.
