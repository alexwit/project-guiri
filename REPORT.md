Guidi is an application platform where tourist are able to get in contact with locals in other citys before they are in the city. It is possible to search for specific users from the city you are travelling to. 

When the tourist(User) finds the right localguide account it can send a request to the  guide if they want to get in contact. If the Guide accepts the request the guide account is saved in to the tourist "Matches" and the tourist is able to see the email adress of the guide to get in contact.
